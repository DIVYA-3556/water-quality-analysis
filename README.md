WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS - A SIMPLE GUIDE

Overview:
Ensuring access to safe drinking water is critical for both public health and food industries.
In this project, we analyze the chemical composition of water samples to predict their safety for human consumption using machine learning models. The analysis focuses on detecting harmful elements like arsenic, lead, nitrates, and assessing key indicators like pH, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity.
This study is particularly important for food technology, where water quality directly impacts food safety, production processes, and product quality.

PROGECT OBJECTIVES:
   *Analyze water samples for key chemical parameters.
   
   *Develop a machine learning classification model to predict water safety.
   
   *Build a Streamlit web application for real-time safety predictions.
   
   *Support food processing units, agricultural operations, and municipal authorities with a tool for quick water safety assessment.

KEY SKILLS GAINED:
    *Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
    
   *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
   *Feature Engineering
   
   *Machine Learning Modeling
   
   *Model Evaluation
   
   *Streamlit Application Development

APPROACH:
   Data Cleaning:
      Correct inconsistencies (e.g., ammonia levels), handle missing values, and standardize features.
          
   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   
   Visualize chemical distributions and assess relationships with water safety.
          
   Feature Engineering:
   
   Normalize data and select impactful features for robust modeling.
         
   Model Development:
    
   Train multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and tune hyperparameters.
        
  Evaluation:
  
   Measure model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
        
   Development:
   
   Build a Streamlit app allowing users to upload new data and receive real-time water safety predictions.
